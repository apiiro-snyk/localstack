class ReactExtension(WebAppBaseExtension):
    """
    EXPERIMENTAL! This class is experimental and the API may change without notice.

    A webapp extension serves routes, templates, and static files via a submount and a subdomain through
    localstack.

    It assumes you have the following directory layout::

        my_extension
        ├── extension.py
        ├── __init__.py
        └──  frontend
            ├── __init__.py
            └── build               <-- make sure everything built is also packaged
                └── index.html

    Given this layout, you can define your extensions in ``my_extension.extension`` like this. Routes defined in the
    extension itself are automatically registered::

        class MyExtension(ReactExtension):
            name = "my-extension"

            @route("/")
            def index(request: Request) -> Response:
                # reference `static/style.css` to serve the static file from your package
                return self.render_template_response("index.html")

            @route("/hello")
            def hello(request: Request):
                return {"message": "Hello World!"}

    This will create an extension that localstack serves via:

    * Submount: https://localhost.localstack.cloud:4566/_extension/my-extension
    * Subdomain: https://my-extension.localhost.localstack.cloud:4566/

    Both are created for full flexibility:

    * Subdomains: create a domain namespace that can be helpful for some extensions, especially when
      running on the local machine
    * Submounts: for some environments, like in ephemeral instances where subdomains are harder to control,
      submounts are more convenient

    Any routes added by the extension will be served relative to these URLs.
